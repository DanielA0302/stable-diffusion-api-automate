## Getting Started

Before contributing, please:

1. Read through the [README.md](README.md) to understand the project
2. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/yuis-ice/stable-diffusion-api-automate/issues) to see if your idea or bug report already exists
3. Look at [pull requests](https://github.com/yuis-ice/stable-diffusion-api-automate/pulls) to see what's being worked on
4. Review this contributing guide thoroughly

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Stable Diffusion WebUI with API enabled
- Git for version control

   cd stable-diffusion-api-automate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local WebUI settings
   ```

5. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Clear title** describing the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Expected behavior** vs **actual behavior**
- **Environment details**:
  - Operating system and version
  - Node.js version
  - WebUI version
  - Tool version
- **Configuration files** (with sensitive data removed)
- **Error messages** or logs
- **Screenshots** if applicable

### Suggesting Enhancements

For feature requests, please provide:

- **Clear description** of the proposed feature
- **Use case** explaining why this would be valuable
- **Implementation ideas** if you have any
- **Alternatives considered**
- **Backward compatibility** considerations

### Types of Contributions Welcome

- **Bug fixes**
- **Feature enhancements**
- **Documentation improvements**
- **Performance optimizations**
- **Test coverage improvements**
- **Code quality improvements**
- **Translation and localization**
- **Example configurations and templates**

## Code Style and Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type annotations where helpful for clarity
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### Code Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons consistently
- Use single quotes for strings
- Maximum line length of 100 characters
- Use trailing commas in multiline structures

### Best Practices

- **Error handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
- **Logging**: Use the existing logging system with appropriate levels
- **Configuration**: Make features configurable when reasonable
- **Documentation**: Update documentation for new features
- **Backward compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes when possible

### Example Code Style

```typescript
interface GenerationConfig {
  prompt: string;
  negativePrompt: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  steps: number;
}

async function processConfig(config: GenerationConfig): Promise<void> {
  try {
    log('Processing configuration...', 'info');
    // Implementation here
  } catch (error) {
    log(`Error processing config: ${error}`, 'error');
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies (WebUI API calls)
- Keep tests focused and independent

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Configuration Loading', () => {
  it('should load valid JSONL configuration file', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle invalid JSON gracefully', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Submitting Changes

1. **Update documentation** if needed
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure all tests pass**
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
5. **Commit with descriptive messages**

### Commit Message Format
